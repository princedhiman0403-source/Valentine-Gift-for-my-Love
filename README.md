 ❤️ For Kiran
From My Heart

Kiran,
this isn’t a project.
It’s a feeling I carry every day.

I made this because loving you has changed me in the gentlest way.
You make ordinary moments feel meaningful.
You make me feel seen, understood, and safe.

What You Mean to Me

You are my calm when life feels loud.
My comfort when I feel tired.
My happiness when I forget how to smile.

With you, love doesn’t feel heavy.
It feels warm.
It feels like home.

A Few Words I Hold Close

Kiran,
I don’t love you loudly—
I love you deeply.
In the quiet ways.
In the everyday moments.
In all the ways that last.

I love you,
more than I know how to explain,
and more than I ever want to stop feeling. ❤️

Always

If this world gets overwhelming,
if days get hard,
if words ever fail me—

know this:
you are loved, fully and endlessly.
And you always will be.

— with all my love 💖
